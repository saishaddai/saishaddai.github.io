# GitHub Pages Project 

Welcome to my **GitHub pages** project!  
This repository is a set of html files to show my current work and experience as a software engineer. This is the v2.0 version. The pages are built with vanilla HTML, Javascript and Tailwind for CSS. It uses google free icons. The design was mostly created with stitch with minor changes made manually by me

## Projects
- This is a short list of personal projects I'm working on or that used to learn new stuff. I will keep it updated and documented as much as I'm able. I'm completely open to collaborate if I can learn a trick or two from you.
